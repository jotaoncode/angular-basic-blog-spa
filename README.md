# Blog example

## Objective

This application is in order to practice a bit more of angularjs, then I will be adding some tools to this app in order to create more complete solution.

This is just a Front End Practice.

## Synopsis

A company wants to help employees to create posts by creating a system that allows CRUD on posts.

It will have a login with only the user name of the employee.

## Installation

$ npm install

## Implementation

As developer:

This is to run server locally, runs on 3000 port

$ npm run server

This is to run gulp with watch, fallbacks to 3001 port, it is important to run first server then gulp because server has no fallback

$ gulp

## Improvements

- Adding environments by configuration.
- Add replace task to gulp
- Apply clear task to gulp.
- Minify app code, it is only minifying vendors.
